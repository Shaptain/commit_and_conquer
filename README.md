## 🔍 How It Works  

ThinkOrbit helps you explore complex research topics in minutes instead of weeks.  
We use arXiv APIs to fetch real scientific papers, and the Gemini API to summarize and map concepts.  

 Example: Searching “Quantum Computing in AI”  
1. Papers fetched directly from arXiv.  
2. Text split and embedded into a vector database.  
3. Gemini API summarizes findings + extracts concepts.  
4. Mindmap generated to show relationships.  
5. Report with citations auto-generated.  
6. Interactive Q&A chatbot answers your questions with sources.
